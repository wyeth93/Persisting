# System Design

Persisting provides durable infrastructure for Agent execution and trajectory
history. This section focuses on the
current public product path:

- [pVisor](../pvisor/index.md) virtualizes and governs one Agent Run;
- [pChronicle](../pchronicle/index.md) organizes durable trajectory Sources into
  queryable Datasets.

Gateway, OverlayFS, and OverlayNet are pVisor runtime mechanisms. Where
available, stable Run identity connects the domains, but each also has a
standalone entry path.

## Cross-product contract

```text

  Gateway trajectory events ─┐
  pVisor lifecycle records ──┴─> canonical event Source ─┐
Pinned external Sources                                  │
  ATIF / ACTF / OpenAI Messages / Storyline ─────────────┴─> Snapshot
                                                               └─> normalized Dataset views
```

Attempt finalization writes a private, versioned Run Bundle and leaves Effects
staged for later review/apply/drop without pChronicle. Configured capture sends
Gateway trajectory events and pVisor lifecycle records, including the Evidence
those records carry. The full Bundle and its Artifact, lineage, Effect, and
broader Evidence inventory remain local unless moved separately.

External file and Storyline Sources are pinned and normalized directly without
passing through pVisor or becoming canonical events. Each path retains
source-specific guarantees; ingestion does not add Evidence that its Source did
not provide.

The ownership boundary is deliberately simple:

- **pVisor owns execution.** It defines one Run's boundary and its model,
  network, and filesystem runtime drivers. Its private Run Bundle remains useful
  even when no history is captured.
- **pChronicle owns history.** It records canonical events and terminal facts,
  then provides Dataset queries, exchange, and revision lineage.

This separation is a practical choice for users: start with execution or
history independently, and add the capture handoff only when the question you
need to answer crosses both domains.

not evidence that a capability is implemented.
