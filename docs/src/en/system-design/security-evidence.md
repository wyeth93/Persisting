# Security and evidence model

Persisting does not compress security into one `safe` or `sandboxed` label.
Every Run reports guarantees by capability dimension. pVisor owns admission
and runtime enforcement. Placement and recovery mechanisms do not upgrade a
pVisor evidence level.
Configured pChronicle capture preserves lifecycle facts and only the Evidence
carried by Gateway or lifecycle event records. The full Run Bundle evidence
inventory remains local unless moved separately.

| Dimension | Example mechanism | Evidence question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Filesystem read | synthetic root, allowlisted projection | Which host paths were visible? |
| Filesystem write | staged OverlayFS, Landlock, Seatbelt | Where could the process tree write? |
| Network | private namespace, virtio-net, proxy policy | Could direct sockets bypass policy? |
| Process | namespace, sandbox profile, inherited-FD cleanup | Which descendants shared the boundary? |
| Credentials | Run-scoped delivery and expiry | Which identity received and used the secret? |
| Effects | stage, promotion decision, compensation record | Which consequences reached the real system? |

Evidence has four useful levels:

1. **Declared** — configuration requested a boundary.
2. **Mediated** — an Agent-facing path passed through a control point.
3. **Enforced** — bypass paths in the stated threat model were blocked.
4. **Attested** — enforcement evidence is bound to the exact Run and provider.

A strong guarantee in one dimension does not upgrade another dimension. A
staged workspace is not proof of network isolation, and captured traffic is not
proof that unobserved sockets were impossible.

The end-to-end chain is:

```text
requested capability
  → admission decision
  → installed mechanism
  → provider evidence
  → observed Effect
  → terminal result
  → configured event-carried history
```

This final event path is narrower than the Run Bundle: it does not currently
publish the complete Artifact, lineage, filesystem Effect,
AgentCtl/network/resource Evidence, output, or metrics inventory.

history boundary.
