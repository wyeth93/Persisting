# pChronicle Snapshot design

> Current implementation notes. Code and historical docs call this the
> Dataset Catalog. The product name is **Snapshot**: the write/read sync
> protocol after a **path** is opened. Platform name-to-path authorization
> is [RFC-0013 path Directory](../../rfcs/0013-pchronicle-warehouse-catalog.md),
> not this page.

> Dataset command arguments are in the [`pchronicle` command reference](../reference/cli.md).
> The user model is [Dataset, Source, and Snapshot](../concepts/dataset-and-source.md).
> The query workflow is [Discover and query](../guides/discover-and-query.md).
> Physical trajectory formats are [pChronicle run storage](trajectory-storage.md)
> and [Storyline three-table Lance](storyline-lance.md).

Format wire contracts and field-by-field conversions follow
[RFC-0001 § Wire schema](../../rfcs/0001-storyline-format.md#wire-schema),
[RFC-0004 § ACTF mapping](../../rfcs/0004-actf-format.md#actf-storyline-json-pointer-mapping),
[RFC-0008 § ATIF mapping](../../rfcs/0008-atif-format.md#atif-storyline-json-pointer-mapping),
and
[RFC-0009 § OpenAI Messages mapping](../../rfcs/0009-openai-messages-format.md#openai-storyline-json-pointer-mapping).

## 1. Role

Snapshot addresses a query space composed of multiple storage locations and
trajectory formats under **one path**. A Warehouse can pin several paths at
once; each path remains an independent Dataset. The main cases are:

- querying live data, historical archives, and evaluation data together;
- one path that contains nested directories, several Run-level
  `events.lance` stores, and peripheral JSON files;
- the same `run_id`, `session_id`, or filename appearing on different paths;
- a Web service that must reuse one discovery result across requests and
  switch views only after an explicit refresh.

It sits between a path and DataFusion SQL. The user opens a path (or
receives one after a Directory ticket). pChronicle recursively discovers
trajectory sources, projects the different physical formats onto stable
tables, and pins members and versions for one query or one generation of
Web Snapshot. This is a write/read sync protocol, not a metadata database
that must be maintained over time.

Snapshot is **not** Directory. It does not copy source data, take over
object-store directories, declare that peripheral JSON has become canonical,
or require a background sync job. The code type name
`DatasetCatalogSnapshot` still refers to this object.

## 2. Goals and non-goals

### 2.1 Goals

1. **Multi-Dataset joins**: one SQL statement can reach several named local
   directories or object-store prefixes.
2. **Hierarchical discovery**: a Dataset URI can point at a storage root, a
   Run root, a composite store, or a single file.
3. **Unified table model**: Storyline, canonical events, ATIF, OpenAI
   messages, and ACTF use the same query table names.
4. **Stable identity**: any Storyline can be located to a physical source
   inside the Snapshot with `(dataset, _file_, session_id)`.
5. **Snapshot consistency**: a query never mixes newly discovered files or
   a new Lance generation into an in-flight execution.
6. **Stable default entry**: a positional argument is always mounted as
   the default Dataset named `dataset`.
7. **Bounded failure**: discovery, format detection, per-file size, parse
   concurrency, and query memory all have explicit limits and error
   policies.
8. **Safe writes**: named mounts are read-only by default. Server-side
   writes can land only on an explicitly chosen canonical events Dataset.
9. **Catalog-aware pruning**: Dataset and `_file_` predicates select
   sources first; the physical scan plan is built after that.
10. **Lazy resolution**: a Catalog Snapshot pins only member and version
    descriptions. Lance datasets, remote objects, and file datasources
    open when a query actually needs them, and are single-flight reused
    inside the Snapshot.

### 2.2 Non-goals

- No persistent catalog service in the style of Hive Metastore or Glue
  Catalog.
- No cross-file index, statistics warehouse, or materialized view inside
  the Catalog.
- No automatic merge of the same `run_id` or `session_id` from different
  sources.
- No distributed transaction or global point-in-time read across
  independent physical sources.
- No Catalog-driven rewrite, move, or conversion of peripheral JSON.
  Long-lived columnar analysis still requires an explicit Lance import.
- No secret management in URI parameters. Object-store authentication
  continues to use each SDK's standard credential chain.

## 3. Core model

![Snapshot query path](/img/diagrams/persisting/dataset-catalog.svg)

The core objects have seven layers:

| Object | Role | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| `DatasetMount` | holds hierarchical namespace, SQL alias, root URI, and optional format hint | configuration |
| `CatalogDataset` | one Dataset and its `DiscoveredSource` list | Snapshot |
| `DiscoveredSource` | logical path, format, version, and status of a composite store or peripheral file | Snapshot |
| `DatasetCatalogSnapshot` | pins members, source versions, and temporary object files for every mount | one CLI query or one Server Catalog generation |
| `LazySource` | holds the pinned source description and caches the first resolve result or error, concurrency-safe | same as the Snapshot |
| `CatalogTableProvider` | prunes sources at the DataFusion `scan` boundary and composes the matching physical plans | each Dataset stable table |
| `ChronicleQueryEngine` | registers the Snapshot as a DataFusion schema and runs read-only SQL | same as the Snapshot |

### 3.1 Namespace, Dataset, and SQL alias

Dataset identity is a normalized path. It is not a physical Lance dataset
and not a Warehouse mount name. One path can contain several Storyline
stores, several `events.lance` stores, and several peripheral files. The
Warehouse registers an opened path as a DataFusion schema through a SQL
alias, so `prod` and `staging` can exist at the same time. The alias is
not Dataset identity. The implementation still uses `NamespacePath` for
mount hierarchy.

A SQL alias is trimmed and lowercased and must match
`[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`. `public` and `information_schema` are reserved.
A namespace component may contain letters, digits, `_`, `-`, and `.`. A
duplicate full namespace or SQL alias fails before discovery.

### 3.2 Source and `_file_`

A Source is the Catalog's smallest discovery unit:

- a Storyline `CURRENT` root is a `store` source;
- a canonical `events.lance` root is a `store` source;
- each JSON, JSONL, or NDJSON file is a `file` source.

`_file_` is the source's UTF-8 logical path relative to the Dataset root,
always separated by `/`. When the mount root itself is the source, the
value is `.`. It is not a persistent column of the source table and is
never written back to Lance.

### 3.3 Storyline and Run identity

`session_id` is the logical primary key of a Storyline, but uniqueness is
guaranteed only inside one source. The same value can appear in a
peripheral file or another archive. Catalog and Server therefore use this
composite key:

```text
(dataset, _file_, session_id)
```

`run_id` is a Run grouping key. One physical Run can contain a main
Storyline and several subagent Storylines, so many rows in the same source
can share one `run_id`. Canonical-event normalization groups by the
event's Storyline/session identity and keeps the actual `events.lance`
URI, so later reads and writes do not guess a physical location from the
mount root.

### 3.4 Source revision

Internally, `CatalogSourceRevision` stores a typed revision. A single
string is not asked to represent a Storyline generation, an event
fact/layout watermark, a local file fingerprint, and an object version at
once. `sources.snapshot_ref` remains a string projection that is convenient
for SQL display and filtering. Consistency checks, Snapshot summaries, and
API descriptions use the typed revision.

One canonical events source can be linked to several derived Storyline
projections. The Catalog does not hide or reject the canonical source
because of that. It selects one read-acceleration projection in the stable
order `fresh → last_modified → generation → path`.
`projection_candidates` exposes the candidate count. When no candidate is
fresh, the query falls back to the pinned canonical events Snapshot.

## 4. Mounts and the default Dataset

### 4.1 CLI form

`--mount NAME=DATASET` may be repeated:

```bash
pchronicle query \
  --mount current=local:///srv/pchronicle/current \
  --mount archive=s3://trajectory-bucket/archive \
  --sql "SELECT * FROM current.runs"
```

`--mount` and a positional Dataset are mutually exclusive. A positional
argument is mounted as the fixed schema `dataset`. With only `--mount`,
the caller must write the mount name; there is no implicit `dataset`
schema. The user config file (`-c`) stores dataset pins as `[pins.<name>]`
tables (including the reserved `default` pin). It does not provide a query mount
table.

```bash
pchronicle query --mount current=local:///srv/pchronicle/current \
  --mount archive=s3://trajectory-bucket/archive \
  --sql "SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables"
```

### 4.2 Default selection

| CLI input | Default Dataset | Unqualified names such as `runs` |
|---|---|---|
| positional `INPUT` | fixed as `dataset` | resolve to `dataset.runs` and the other default views |
| `--mount` only (one or more) | none | must use a qualified name such as `current.runs` |

Positional form:

```bash
pchronicle query ./capture --sql "SELECT * FROM dataset.runs"
```

This is equivalent to mounting `./capture` as `dataset` and querying
`dataset.runs`. Cross-Dataset joins use repeated `--mount`. Do not put a
positional Dataset and `--mount` on the same command.

## 5. Hierarchical discovery

### 5.1 Example

Assume this mounted directory:

```text
capture-root/
├── live/
│   └── CURRENT
├── agents/
│   └── codex/
│       └── run-001/
│           └── events.lance/
│               └── _manifest.json
└── imports/
    ├── batch-a.atif.jsonl
    └── nested/
        └── session.json
```

The Catalog produces four sources:

| `_file_` | `kind` | Possible `format` |
|---|---|---|
| `live` | `store` | `storyline` |
| `agents/codex/run-001/events.lance` | `store` | `events` |
| `imports/batch-a.atif.jsonl` | `file` | `atif` |
| `imports/nested/session.json` | `file` | detected from the file |

Internal files of `live` and `events.lance` do not become sources again.
Stopping descent after a composite root is recognized keeps manifests,
generations, segments, and `objects.lance` from being treated as user
input.

When a directory contains `chronicle.manifest`
([RFC-0015](../../rfcs/0015-chronicle-manifest.md)), discovery prefers that
sidecar: a `leaf` with `format = compact-jsonl/v1` becomes a Compact source
without opening Lance solely to classify it; a `branch` scans only immediate
child directories that also have the sidecar. Explorer folder totals may use
leaf `record_count` with read-side roll-up; writers update only the leaf
manifest and do not rewrite ancestors.

### 5.2 Local discovery

Local URIs accept ordinary paths, `local://`, and `file://`:

1. If the root is a `.json`, `.jsonl`, or `.ndjson` file, create a single
   source.
2. If the root directory contains `CURRENT`, the whole root is one
   Storyline source.
3. If the root is named `events.lance` and contains `_manifest.json`, the
   whole root is one events source.
4. Otherwise recurse in stable path order: recognize composite roots, or
   collect supported peripheral files.
5. Symbolic links are not followed, which avoids cycles, out-of-tree
   reads, and duplicate identities for the same physical file.

### 5.3 Object-store discovery

Object URIs are resolved through the Lance/object-store adapter. The
Catalog consumes a prefix listing as a stream and fails before it reads
`max_entries + 1` objects. It does not collect an unbounded listing into
memory and check afterwards. Then:

1. recognize Storyline roots from a `CURRENT` object;
2. recognize canonical events roots from `events.lance/_manifest.json`;
3. exclude every object inside a composite root;
4. treat remaining `.json`, `.jsonl`, and `.ndjson` objects as independent
   sources;
5. sort by Dataset-relative object key.

Current object backends reuse the URI schemes that pChronicle/Lance
already support, such as `s3://`, `az://`, and `gs://`. A failed mount or
listing means a trusted member set cannot be built, so even `report` mode
fails.

### 5.4 Format detection

Each peripheral file is detected independently, so one Dataset can mix
ATIF, OpenAI messages, and ACTF. `pchronicle query` does not impose a
format constraint on the Dataset. `--source` on `find` and `export` only
narrows the search to one Dataset-relative Source path; it is not a
format hint.

Neither local nor remote peripheral files are read at Catalog-build time
for autodetection. Without an explicit format hint, `sources.format` may
be `NULL`. The Catalog first freezes the local file fingerprint or remote
object version, then runs bounded format detection after `_file_` pruning
selects that source. The detection result is cached on the Snapshot's
`LazySource` together with the datasource resolve result.

## 6. SQL provider

The Dataset's stable public relations, exact `sources` columns,
Source-local identity, and join rules belong to the
[Query Model Reference](../reference/query-model.md). This section only
explains how the Catalog builds execution plans for those relations.

Peripheral files do not synthesize fake raw event rows. They are queried
only through Storyline-normalized relations. The Catalog adds a constant
`_file_` to entity relations so the public Source identity connects to the
lazy physical Source.

### 6.1 Catalog-aware source pruning

`runs`, `steps`, `tool_calls`, and `events` are each provided by a
Dataset-level `CatalogTableProvider`. After DataFusion hands projection,
filters, and limit to the provider, the provider builds the physical plan
in this order:

1. drop sources that cannot provide the target table — for example
   `events` automatically excludes Storyline and peripheral files;
2. evaluate recognizable filter expressions against each source's constant
   `_file_`;
3. skip sources that cannot match, without calling `LazySource::resolve`;
4. resolve candidates in stable source order, capped by
   `max_concurrent_sources`, and pass business-column projection, business
   predicates, and limit on to each native provider;
5. zero hits produce `EmptyExec`; one hit uses that plan directly; several
   hits produce `UnionExec`; a global limit is applied last when needed.

`_file_` predicates that can prune exactly include `=`, `!=`, `IN`,
`NOT IN`, case-sensitive `LIKE`/`NOT LIKE`, and combinations of `AND`,
`OR`, and `NOT` that can be evaluated safely. Expressions that mix source
conditions with business conditions use conservative three-valued logic:
a source is skipped only when it can be proved impossible to match. For
example:

```sql
SELECT run_id, session_id
FROM archive.runs
WHERE _file_ LIKE '2026/08/%'
  AND session_id = 'session-42';
```

Here `LIKE` prunes sources at the Catalog layer. `session_id` is pushed
into the Lance or file provider of each hit. Without a `_file_`
predicate, the Catalog has no cross-source `run_id` or time statistics, so
every compatible source of the target table is a candidate. Business
predicates can still be pushed down inside each native provider.

`LazySource` caches the resolve result in an async `OnceCell`. Concurrent
queries that hit the same source open, remotely materialize, or parse the
format only once. Resolve-phase failures are cached too, so behavior is
stable inside one Snapshot. The raw `events` table of canonical events
can scan pinned segments directly. Without a fresh projection, a query
with a provable `session_id = ...` or `session_id IN (...)` reads only
the full history of the target Storyline. Wide queries read the pinned
snapshot. Both fallbacks are bounded by `max_event_fallback_rows` and
`max_event_fallback_bytes`, and they materialize only the relation tables
the current query asked for. Over-budget cases require a build/sync of
the Storyline projection.
`load_events` point lookups read the target session directly and do not
build a DataFusion MemTable, but they use the same row and byte budgets.

`EXPLAIN` can inspect the pruned physical plan. An exact single-source
hit should not contain `UnionExec`.

### 6.2 Join rules

One Dataset can contain several physical sources, and `run_id`/`session_id`
are valid only inside a single source. When two built-in trajectory tables
join across several same-Dataset sources, an explicit `_file_` equality
is required:

```sql
SELECT r.run_id, s.step_id, s.message_kind, s.message_value
FROM archive.runs r
JOIN archive.steps s
  ON r._file_ = s._file_
 AND r.session_id = s.session_id;
```

Omitting `_file_` is rejected before execution. Cross-Dataset joins do
not require matching `_file_` values, because the left and right
namespaces are already different and usually do not share a directory
layout:

```sql
SELECT c.run_id, a.run_id AS archived_run
FROM current.runs c
JOIN archive.runs a ON c.session_id = a.session_id;
```

The check applies to built-in joins of `runs`, `steps`, and `tool_calls`.
The query engine accepts a single read-only `SELECT`, `VALUES`,
`DESCRIBE`, or `EXPLAIN`. It rejects DDL, DML, `COPY`, and multi-statement
SQL.

## 7. Snapshots and consistency

### 7.1 Build process

One Catalog build completes in this order:

```text
parse and validate mounts
  → freeze candidate members of each root
  → pin identity / CURRENT / manifest / object metadata of each candidate
  → build sources metadata
  → compute snapshot_id
  → register Dataset schema, CatalogTableProvider, and default views
  → publish to query or Server
```

Only a fully successful `DatasetCatalogSnapshot` is handed to the query
engine. The build does not open Lance datasets, copy remote JSON locally,
or normalize canonical events into Storyline three-table form.

### 7.2 How each source is pinned

| Source | Member pin | Content/version pin |
|---|---|---|
| local peripheral file | freeze the path list at discovery | record path, size, mtime, and device/inode on Unix; re-check before and after the first read |
| remote peripheral object | freeze listing `ObjectMeta` | after a hit, read with the pinned version/ETag, stream-copy into the Snapshot temp directory, and verify the final size |
| Storyline store | discover and read the `CURRENT` description | freeze the generation and the exact versions of the three tables; open the Lance dataset only after a hit |
| canonical events | discover and read `_manifest.json` | freeze the manifest revision and visible segment versions; open segments only after a hit |

Only remote objects selected by a query are copied. Copies write chunks
into a temporary file held by the Snapshot; the whole object is never
read into memory at once. The temporary directory is removed when the
Snapshot is dropped. A local fingerprint is change detection, not a
content hash: an attacker who rewrites a file in place while keeping the
same identity, size, and mtime is outside the guarantee.

### 7.3 Consistency bounds

A Snapshot guarantees:

- query planning and execution see the same source member set;
- even a late-opened Storyline/events store can open only the generation,
  manifest, and segment versions already pinned by the Snapshot — it does
  not re-read the latest pointers;
- when the backend provides a version or ETag, a remote peripheral object
  is pinned to the version observed at listing time;
- new files, generations, or manifests become visible only on the next
  CLI query or an explicit refresh.

A Snapshot does not claim that several independent URIs come from one
global transaction instant, and it cannot stop a source system from
deleting data that was pinned but not yet read. If a local file changes
detectably between discovery and first read, the query fails rather than
mixing versions. If an object backend provides neither version nor ETag,
the Catalog can only describe `snapshot_ref` with key, size, and mtime
and verify transfer size. That is a weaker object-version pin.

`snapshot_id` is a truncated BLAKE3 digest of Dataset names, URIs, format
hints, source-relative paths, pinned references, and candidate errors. It
identifies a member/version view. It is not a content checksum and not a
business commit ID.

### 7.4 Resolve lifetime

Each ready source in the Snapshot holds a pinned description and a
resolve cell. On first hit:

```text
CatalogTableProvider source pruning
  → LazySource::resolve
  → open the pinned Lance version, or verify/materialize the pinned file
  → create the native TableProvider
  → cache Result<ResolvedSource>
```

Laziness therefore does not change the Snapshot boundary: resolve happens
late, but the resolve target was pinned before the Catalog was published.
A source that no query hits can stay unopened for the whole Snapshot
lifetime.

## 8. Error policy and resource bounds

`list`/`ls` and `stats` expose two strategies through `--errors`:

| Strategy | One candidate cannot pin a description or pass initial validation | Dataset root missing, listing/walk failed, or a global limit exceeded |
|---|---|---|
| `strict` | Catalog build fails | Catalog build fails |
| `report` | write `<dataset>.sources` with status `error` and skip data-table registration | Catalog build fails |

`report` is meant to tolerate a bad file inside a trusted member set. It
is not meant to disguise an incomplete listing as success. Candidate
errors strip the URI query string before they enter the public Catalog,
so a temporary signature is not reflected. Production configuration
should still keep credentials out of URIs. Lance open, remote conditional
read, format detection, or record-parse errors that appear only at SQL
scan time fail that query under both `strict` and `report`. They never
silently drop a ready source, and they never rewrite `sources.status` on
the immutable Snapshot after the fact.

The Catalog reuses the resource parameters of direct file query:

- `max_files`: upper bound on candidate sources;
- `max_entries`: upper bound on directory entries or object listing
  items;
- `max_detection_bytes`: upper bound on format-detection input;
- `max_file_bytes`: upper bound on peripheral file/object size;
- optional `max_record_bytes`, `max_concurrent_files`, and cache
  parameters: resolve-time bounds. There is no default per-record size
  limit; `max_file_bytes` limits the source;
- `max_concurrent_sources`: how many sources one physical scan may
  resolve at once;
- `max_event_fallback_rows`, `max_event_fallback_bytes`: memory bound
  for one directed canonical→Storyline fallback when no fresh
  projection exists;
- DataFusion memory pool, spill path, spill bytes, timeout, and output
  row count: query-time bounds.

## 9. Server, refresh, and Web

`pchronicle serve` mounts Datasets through one or more positional
`[NAME=]DATASET` arguments. Startup first converges canonical Storyline
projections, then builds the initial Catalog. Every later REST and SQL
request shares that Catalog.

| API | Semantics |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/catalog` | current `snapshot_id`, creation time, default Dataset, error policy, and source list |
| `POST /api/catalog` | build a complete new Snapshot off the lock, replace atomically on success, and clear the trajectory cache |

When the projection supervisor discovers a new canonical Store at
runtime, or a projection is published, it marks the Catalog dirty, then
rebuilds completely off the lock and switches atomically. Further
appends to an already discovered `events.lance` only advance the source
watermark; they do not trigger a global Catalog rebuild. A Gateway-backed
single-trace query first locates the source through the Catalog, then
reopens the latest canonical manifest, so an in-flight trace stays
visible while the Storyline projection waits for an idle window. A failed
refresh does not clear or partially update the old Catalog. It keeps the
dirty flag and retries within a bound. In-flight requests hold an `Arc`
to the old Snapshot and can finish.
Web Explorer takes the Dataset list from the Catalog. Server-side
filters, URL state, and Storyline lists all carry the full
`(dataset, _file_, session_id)`. `run_id` is returned separately as
physical Run grouping. The Catalog is an immutable Snapshot.
`POST /api/catalog` can still refresh explicitly, but canonical updates
maintained by positional-Dataset `serve` produce a new Snapshot
automatically.

### 9.1 Server source-routing acceleration

The Server holds a rebuildable in-memory acceleration structure inside
each `CatalogRuntime` generation. It does not change the definitions of
`DatasetCatalogSnapshot`, `CatalogDataset`, or `DiscoveredSource`.
Indexes are derived on demand from the current Snapshot's stable tables:

- the `runs` index maps `run_id`, `session_id`, `agent_id`, and
  `agent_model_name` to source ids as a multi-value map;
- `events` uses a two-level lazy index: the identity layer holds
  `event_id` and `trace_id`; the partition layer holds `session_id` and
  `agent_id`. Project lists do not pay memory cost for high-cardinality
  event identities;
- source paths are stored once per Dataset. Value keys use a
  per-generation keyed 64-bit fingerprint. A single-source hit inlines
  the integer source id. A hash collision only widens the candidate set;
  the original SQL predicates still do the final filter;
- Run lists are cached lazily on a separate path so SQL point queries do
  not pay for Explorer `row_count` aggregation.

An index is built only when the first single-table query with a routable
predicate arrives. Async single-flight prevents concurrent duplicate
scans. Construction uses an Arrow batch stream and does not collect the
full result. One index layer accepts at most 1,000,000 rows and
1,000,000 distinct values. Crossing that bound discards the unpublished
temporary index and falls back to the original query. The Server extracts
only string equalities or `IN` predicates that must hold from the top-level
`AND`. Joins, CTEs, disjunctions, complex expressions, an existing
`_file_` predicate, too many candidate sources, or an index-build failure
all keep the original SQL. On a hit, the Server only adds `_file_ = ...`
or `_file_ IN (...)`; DataFusion still evaluates the original business
predicates. The index can only shrink physical source candidates. It
cannot change result semantics.

The `acceleration` field of `GET /api/catalog` reports whether indexes
are built and their row, source, and distinct-value counts. `failed`
lists build failures already cached for this generation so later requests
do not rescan the whole table. `POST /api/query/evidence` reports
`applied`, `already_pruned`, `not_applicable`, `not_selective`, or
`index_unavailable` in the `source_routing` response field. A Catalog
refresh publishes the new Snapshot, query engine, and empty acceleration
structure as one runtime. Old requests keep the old runtime. Indexes are
not reused across `snapshot_id` values.

The first index build still scans the corresponding stable table. The
main gain is later point/project queries in the same Server lifetime.
One-shot CLI SQL does not use this state and does not turn the Catalog
into a persistent metadata service.

### 9.2 Write boundary

`pchronicle serve` exposes reads, Catalog refresh, and bounded evidence
query only. It does not expose maintenance, import, or arbitrary SQL
writes. The service is forced to loopback. Gateway and native writers
write the Dataset directly and do not go through the Warehouse API.

## 10. Rust API boundary

The core API is provided by `persisting-pchronicle`:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use persisting_pchronicle::{
    CatalogSnapshotOptions, ChronicleQueryEngine, DatasetCatalogSnapshot, DatasetMount,
};

let mounts = vec![
    DatasetMount::new("current", "local:///srv/pchronicle/current")?,
    DatasetMount::new("archive", "s3://trajectory-bucket/archive")?,
];
let snapshot = Arc::new(
    DatasetCatalogSnapshot::discover(mounts, None, CatalogSnapshotOptions::default()).await?,
);
let engine = ChronicleQueryEngine::from_catalog_snapshot(snapshot).await?;
let rows = engine
    .query_jsonl("SELECT COUNT(*) AS runs FROM archive.runs")
    .await?;
```

To read a complete trajectory by Storyline, call the Snapshot's
`load_storyline`, `load_events`, or `canonical_event_uri` with a
`CatalogStorylineKey`. The control plane can page through the same
Snapshot with `list_namespaces`, `list_sources`, and `describe_source`.
Page tokens are bound to `snapshot_id` and cannot be reused after a
refresh. Callers must not rediscover sources around the Snapshot; that
can splice different members or versions into one response.

## 11. Key invariants

Implementation and later extensions must keep these invariants:

1. Namespace is hierarchical logical identity. A SQL alias is an
   independent, unique lowercase schema name. The two must not be mixed
   into one field.
2. `_file_` is stable inside one Snapshot and relative to the Dataset
   root. The root source is always `.`.
3. A Catalog Storyline's full identity is always
   `(dataset, _file_, session_id)`. `run_id` is only for Run grouping.
4. After a composite store is recognized, its internal files must not be
   registered as independent sources.
5. The six tables must exist even when empty, and they keep a fixed
   schema.
6. `events` can contain only canonical events. It must not be forged
   backwards from a lossy Storyline.
7. Trajectory-table joins across several sources in the same Dataset must
   carry `_file_` equality.
8. A query-time source cannot outlive the Snapshot that holds it.
9. The Server publishes only a complete new Snapshot atomically. On
   failure it keeps serving the old Snapshot.
10. The Warehouse Server must not treat any Dataset or source as a write
    target.
11. `_file_` source pruning must happen before `LazySource::resolve`. A
    source must not be opened just to decide whether it hits.
12. Late resolve may use only the version description pinned by the
    Snapshot, and it must single-flight inside that Snapshot. It must
    not re-follow `CURRENT` or the latest manifest at resolve time.
13. When several projections attach to the same canonical events source,
    the canonical source must remain visible and at most one fresh
    projection is chosen stably. Conflicts can only become diagnostics;
    they must not block fact reads.
14. The Server routing index must be published with the same Snapshot
    generation. Uncertain build or analysis can only fall back to the
    original query. An incomplete index must not exclude a source.

## 12. Trade-offs and alternatives

### 12.1 A persistent metadata service

A persistent Catalog can cache listings and statistics, but it introduces
consistency protocols, migrations, background sync, authorization, and
disaster recovery. The current workload needs a definite bound on "what
this one query sees", so the design uses a query-time Snapshot. If
listing cost becomes the main bottleneck later, a verifiable cache can be
added without changing the SQL model.

### 12.2 Flattening every mount into `public`

Flattened tables cannot tell live data from archives, and `_file_` would
have to encode a URI or Dataset name. DataFusion schemas keep the Dataset
semantics the user supplied and make cross-Dataset SQL explicitly
reviewable.

### 12.3 Using the directory basename as the default name

A basename depends on path spelling, object prefixes, and deployment
directories. Unqualified SQL would not get a stable resolution. The
positional entry therefore always uses the fixed name `dataset` instead
of guessing a name from the URI.

### 12.4 Importing everything to Lance at discovery

Automatic import of peripheral JSON would change query latency, capacity,
and failure semantics, and it would create new persistent state. The
Catalog therefore only virtualizes those files. Canonical `events.lance`
is the exception: positional-Dataset `serve` maintains a deterministic
sibling Storyline projection outside the Catalog. Queries still choose a
projection or a pinned-snapshot fallback by lineage and freshness.

### 12.5 Using only `run_id`

`run_id` is a grouping key, not the Storyline primary key. The main Agent
and subagents in one physical Run can share it. Locating by
`(dataset, _file_, session_id)` keeps the physical origin and supports
unambiguous read/write routing.

## 13. Tests and evolution

Current tests cover:

- Dataset name normalization, reserved names, and duplicate rejection;
- local mixed-format recursive discovery, default views, and empty
  Dataset schema;
- `strict`/`report` candidate-error behavior;
- source-resolve counts remaining zero after Catalog and query-engine
  construction;
- `_file_` plus business predicates resolving only the hit local, remote,
  and Storyline sources;
- single-source physical plans with no `UnionExec`, and no download of
  unhit remote objects;
- late errors not being silently skipped under `report`;
- raw canonical `events` scans and session point lookups not triggering
  full Storyline normalization;
- stable selection of one among several fresh projections, with canonical
  events always visible;
- hierarchical namespace paging, source describe, and cross-Snapshot
  page-token rejection;
- dangerous same-Dataset joins rejected and cross-Dataset joins allowed;
- independent reads of several Storylines in one canonical events source;
- CLI positional arguments, single/multi named mounts, TOML, and help
  text;
- Server lazy Catalog, Dataset filtering, failed refresh keeping the old
  Snapshot, and physical write coordinates;
- Server routing-index multi-predicate intersection, single-source SQL
  injection, result equivalence, explicit `_file_` preservation, and
  clear-on-refresh;
- Web Dataset selection and full Run-coordinate encoding.

When a new format or backend is added later, define first how it produces
a stable `_file_`, how it pins versions, which tables it can project, and
whether writes are allowed, then attach a discoverer. A backend that
cannot pin members or versions must lower its consistency claim
explicitly. It must not reuse the existing `snapshot_ref` to imply a
stronger guarantee.
