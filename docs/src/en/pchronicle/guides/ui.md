# Use the local Web UI

`pchronicle serve` provides a loopback-only, read-only workspace for browsing
Datasets, drilling into Runs, analyzing results, and inspecting Lance
storage. The screenshots and examples on this page were produced directly by:

```bash
./target/release/pchronicle serve tmp/test/ data/ --listen 127.0.0.1:9980
```

After the listener is ready, open [http://127.0.0.1:9980/](http://127.0.0.1:9980/). This command mounts
two Datasets. Because neither has an explicit name, the UI derives `test` and
`data` from the last path component. Give mounts stable UI and SQL schema names
when they will be reused:

```bash
./target/release/pchronicle serve \
  test=tmp/test data=data \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:9980
```

Add `--open` to open the system browser after the listener is ready. The server
accepts loopback addresses only. Browsing, querying, and refreshing through the
UI or API do not modify a mounted Dataset.

## Workspace map

The left rail separates the common tasks into five surfaces:

| Surface | Use it to |
| --- | --- |
| **Datasets** | See mounted Datasets and Run counts, then enter Runs. |
| **Runs** | Filter by path, Dataset, status, or text and open one Run. |
| **Analysis** | Inspect available fields and analyze with a question or read-only SQL. |
| **Storage** | Inspect Lance tables, data groups, column distributions, and storage size. |
| **Assistant** | Ask about the current Run after configuring a compatible model. |

**Local** at the bottom of the rail indicates that the UI is connected to the
local pChronicle server.

![The Datasets page shows the test and data Datasets and their Run counts](/img/screenshots/pchronicle/data-overview.jpg)

**Datasets** is the landing page. Each card shows a Dataset name and Run count.
Select a card to open that Dataset's data overview, then use **Open in Runs**
to open the current scope. The button with the same name on the landing page
opens all Runs.

## Browse and filter Runs

![The Runs page combines a path tree with a filterable Run table](/img/screenshots/pchronicle/runs-browser.jpg)

The Runs page combines a path tree and a result table:

1. Select a Dataset, folder level, or Session in **Run paths**. The number at
   the right of a node is the number of Runs below it.
2. Search for an Agent, Session, root, or status. Use the adjacent controls to
   constrain Dataset and status, then choose the sort field and direction.
3. Read Session, Agent / Model, status, event count, and root in the table.
   Select a row to open its detail page.
4. Use **Refresh** after the underlying data changes. Use Previous / Next when
   the result spans several pages.

The path tree is useful for narrowing the hierarchy before applying text and
status filters. For example, select `data` and then the status you need, or
paste a known Session ID directly into the search box.

## Read one Run

![The Run detail page shows summary metrics, coverage, and ordered steps](/img/screenshots/pchronicle/run-detail.jpg)

The Run page has three layers:

- The header identifies the Agent, Session, status, and root. **Ask Assistant**
  and **Analyze this run** carry the current Run into another workspace.
- Summary cards show Steps, Tools, Explicit errors, Tokens, and Latency P95.
  Composition, Behavior, Models, and Coverage make the Run makeup and
  available observability data visible at a glance.
- **Timeline** exposes recorded details. Switch between **Conversations / Steps**, filter
  by role or text, and expand a row to inspect complete text, tool calls, and
  event references. **Analysis** opens the Run-level analysis view.

Timeline bars show records at their positions in the Session sequence; they are
not a wall-clock latency chart. Captured text, tool calls, and metrics remain usable.

## Analyze Datasets

![Analysis runs read-only SQL and profiles the returned rows in Result Explorer](/img/screenshots/pchronicle/analysis-sql.jpg)

The left panel lists the queryable tables and fields for each Dataset. A mount
name is also its SQL schema, so this example exposes `test.runs`, `data.runs`,
and related tables.

Choose one input mode:

- **Ask** accepts a natural-language question. Configure an OpenAI-compatible
  model in **Model settings** first. pChronicle creates an analysis plan and
  then executes a size-limited, read-only query.
- **Write SQL** executes SQL directly. Handwritten SQL is not repaired by the
  model, so confirm exact column names in the schema panel.

For example, count Runs by Agent in `data`:

```sql
SELECT agent_name, COUNT(*) AS runs
FROM data.runs
GROUP BY agent_name
ORDER BY runs DESC
```

**Result Explorer** shows rows, column types, missing rates, and the distribution
of the selected column. Results are limited by the row and size limit displayed
by the UI. If optional model interpretation fails, returned SQL rows and column
profiles remain available; fix the model settings or retry the summary without
discarding the results.

## Inspect Lance storage

![Storage shows Lance data groups, column value distributions, and storage size](/img/screenshots/pchronicle/storage-layout.jpg)

Storage is an advanced diagnostic surface, not a prerequisite for browsing
Runs. The left panel shows Lance tables and their data groups by Dataset. The
right panel profiles row counts, non-null counts, encoded storage size, value
distribution, and size distribution for each column. Use it to determine:

- which table or column consumes the most storage;
- whether a column is mostly missing or has a suspicious distribution;
- whether a Dataset has a stored projection ready for analysis.

This page inspects the existing layout. It does not expose compaction, rewrite,
or maintenance operations.

## Configure Assistant

![Assistant Browser BYOK settings include API base, API key, and Model](/img/screenshots/pchronicle/assistant-settings.jpg)

1. Open **Assistant** from the left rail, then select the settings gear.
2. Enter the OpenAI-compatible **API base**, **API key**, and **Model**.
3. Select **Save locally**, return to a Run, and use **Ask Assistant**.

This is browser BYOK. The key stays in this browser's `localStorage`; selected
Run data is sent directly from the browser to the configured model endpoint,
and the pChronicle server never receives the key. Do not save a key in an
untrusted or shared browser profile. Clearing this site's browser data also
clears the setting. Assistant is labeled **Read-only · selected run data** and
does not rewrite the Dataset.

When `pchronicle serve --catalog-config` is used, every library in the ACL file
is already mounted for local browsing. Open **Keys** on the left rail if you
need Directory user access/secret headers for authenticated Directory flows.
Those values are stored in `localStorage` and sent to this pchronicle server as
`x-pchronicle-access-key` and `x-pchronicle-secret-key` on data requests. They
authorize which Directory paths this browser may open; they are not the
object-store backend keys.

## Troubleshooting

### `127.0.0.1:9980` is already in use

Choose another loopback port:

```bash
./target/release/pchronicle serve tmp/test/ data/ --listen 127.0.0.1:9981
```

### Dataset names are not what you expected

Multiple bare paths derive names from their last path component. Use
`NAME=DATASET`, such as `evals=data/`, to make the UI name and SQL schema stable.

### Ask or Assistant cannot send

Open **Model settings** or the Assistant settings gear and configure a working
OpenAI-compatible endpoint, key, and model. Use **Write SQL** in Analysis when no
model is needed.

### SQL reports a missing field

Select the target table in Analysis and confirm the field name in the left
panel. The mount name is the schema. The UI requires you to fix and rerun
handwritten SQL; it does not ask a model to rewrite it.

### The Dataset changed but the UI still shows old data

Return to Runs and select **Refresh**. pChronicle replaces the readable view
only after the replacement is ready; a failed refresh leaves the previous view
available.

For all server options, see [Serve Datasets locally](serve.md). For exact CLI
arguments, see the [`pchronicle` reference](../reference/cli.md).
