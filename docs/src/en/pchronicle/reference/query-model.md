# Query model reference

Every mounted Dataset is a SQL schema. A positional Dataset is named `dataset`;
`--mount NAME=DATASET` creates a named schema. The schema exposes six stable
relations even when no compatible Source contributes rows.

| Relation | One row represents | Available from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sources` | one discovered Source candidate | every Dataset |
| `runs` | one normalized Run/session | every ready run data source |
| `steps` | one normalized Step | every ready run data source |
| `tool_calls` | one tool invocation and its linked result | every ready run data source |
| `events` | one canonical write-time fact | canonical event Sources only |
| `trajectories` | one complete Run with ordered Step and tool aggregates | normalized run data sources |

Use `DESCRIBE` for the exact columns exposed by the installed version:

```sql
DESCRIBE dataset.sources;
DESCRIBE dataset.runs;
DESCRIBE dataset.steps;
DESCRIBE dataset.tool_calls;
DESCRIBE dataset.events;
DESCRIBE dataset.trajectories;
```

## Source identity

Entity IDs are Source-local. `runs`, `steps`, `tool_calls`, and `events` retain
`_file_`, the Dataset-relative `source_path`. A durable entity address includes
the Dataset URI, `_file_`, entity kind, and original ID.

When joining built-in Run relations inside one Dataset, include `_file_`
alongside the entity key:

```sql
SELECT r.run_id, s.step_id, s.message_kind, s.message_value
FROM dataset.runs r
JOIN dataset.steps s
  ON r._file_ = s._file_
 AND r.session_id = s.session_id;
```

A built-in join that omits `_file_` is rejected because equal IDs in two
Sources do not identify the same entity. Across separately named Datasets,
`_file_` equality is not required because each schema is already a different
namespace.

## `sources`

| Column | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_file_` | UTF-8, non-null | Dataset-relative Source path |
| `format` | UTF-8, nullable | detected or declared representation |
| `kind` | UTF-8, non-null | `store` or `file` |
| `snapshot_ref` | UTF-8, nullable | generation, manifest revision, fingerprint, version, or ETag |
| `projection_status` | UTF-8, nullable | `fresh` or `stale` for a canonical events Source with a linked Storyline projection |
| `projection_generation` | UTF-8, nullable | generation selected as the read acceleration projection |
| `projection_candidates` | UInt64, non-null | number of linked projection candidates considered |
| `size_bytes` | UInt64, nullable | candidate file or marker-object size |
| `last_modified` | UTF-8, nullable | RFC 3339 timestamp when available |
| `status` | UTF-8, non-null | `ready` or `error` |
| `error` | UTF-8, nullable | sanitized discovery or resolution error |

`format` may remain null until a selected peripheral file is opened lazily.
Filtering `_file_` can prevent unrelated Sources from being opened.
`snapshot_ref` is a display projection; Rust/API consumers use the typed
`CatalogSourceRevision` for consistency decisions.

## Find expressions

`pchronicle find --match` is the current locate syntax. The installed CLI
parser (`FindExpr`) is authoritative.
[RFC-0012](../../rfcs/0012-pchronicle-find-query-syntax.md) records the accepted
decision and is not a command reference.

Plain terms search indexed Storyline Step content (FTS / Jieba). Scoped text
uses `#field(term)`:

| Selector | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `#content` | `message_value`, `observation`, and `prompt` |
| `#message` | `message_value` |
| `#user` | `message_value` where `source = 'user'` |
| `#assistant` | `message_value` where `source = 'agent'` (`#agent` is an alias) |
| `#system` | `prompt` and `message_value` where `source = 'system'` |
| `#reasoning` | `reasoning_content` |
| `#observation` | `observation` |
| `#prompt` | `prompt` and `message_value` |
| `#model` | `model_name` (`#model_name` is an alias) |
| `#env` | `env` |
| `#all` | all indexed Step text columns |

`AND` / `OR` / `NOT` and parentheses combine predicates. JSONB uses
`$.path OP value` or `#json.COLUMN("$.path") OP value`, where `OP` is
`=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, or `<=`. Repeat `--match` to AND expressions.

The current implementation infers `search.scope` from the expression:

| Expression | `search.scope` | `search.mode` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text only | `steps` | `fts` |
| JSON only, no Step column | `runs` | `json` |
| `#json.metrics(...)` only | `steps` | `json` |
| Text plus JSON | `steps` | `fts+json` |
| Identity flags only | `runs` | `identity` |

A JSON-only expression without `#json.metrics(...)` searches run-level JSONB
columns (`agent_extra`, `final_metrics`, `extra`, `meta`, `unknown_fields`).
Mixed text/JSON and explicit `#json.metrics(...)` search step-level JSONB
(`metrics`, `extra`).

## Query boundary

The engine accepts one read-only `SELECT`, `VALUES`, `DESCRIBE`, or `EXPLAIN`
statement. It rejects DDL, DML, `COPY`, mutating functions, and multiple
statements. CLI row, byte, discovery, and timeout limits still apply.

Exact physical Storyline columns are documented by
[Storyline Lance](../design/storyline-lance.md). Discovery and predicate-pruning
mechanisms belong to [Snapshot design](../design/catalog.md). Use the
[query guide](../guides/discover-and-query.md) for a complete workflow.
