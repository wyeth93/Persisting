# OverlayNet transparent interception

This document owns interception mechanisms, enforcement gaps, and acceptance
gates. User policy procedures belong to the
[network guide](../guides/network.md); the capability model belongs to
[Capabilities and evidence](../concepts/capabilities-and-evidence.md).

!!! note "Target architecture"
    The libkrun VM driver described first is implemented. Design A, Design B,
    and delivery-plan items 1–5 describe target host/container interception
    and acceptance gates; they are not current public capabilities.

## Implemented VM driver

libkrun VM Attempts now use `vm-smoltcp` when `[overlaynet].mode = "auto"`.
The guest virtio-net device connects to pVisor over libkrun's length-prefixed
UnixStream Ethernet transport. pVisor serves DHCP (`192.0.2.1` router,
`192.0.2.2` guest), synthetic DNS (`198.18.0.0/15`, stable per Attempt), and
IPv4 TCP. A SYN remains paused in smoltcp until hostname/IP, resolved address
or scoped host connector alias, port, and injected Control policy all authorize
and the host connection succeeds. TSI stays disabled, so there is no guest
path around this data plane.

Some host DNS/TUN connectors return an opaque `198.18.0.0/15` fake IP for an
authorized hostname. The VM connector accepts that result only after the
logical hostname and port pass policy and Control authorization; guest IP
literals in the same range remain blocked. Because the connector hides the
real final address, IP/CIDR policy cannot inspect the endpoint behind that
alias. Deployments that require final-address policy should use a resolver
that exposes concrete addresses.

The MVP intentionally fails closed for general UDP, IPv6, ICMP, QUIC, inbound
connections, virtual/link-local/multicast/broadcast destinations, and exhausted
flow/DNS capacity. Explicit Gateway capture is an internal virtual-router route;
all ordinary egress shares the same policy and bandwidth registry. Host and
container transparent interception described below remains future work.

## Problem

OverlayNet's host/container data plane is an explicit HTTP/HTTPS proxy. pVisor
injects proxy environment variables and, for known Agent CLIs, proxy
configuration arguments. Coverage is therefore opt-in: any child process that
ignores proxy environment variables — a static Go binary, a raw socket, a
subprocess that scrubs its environment — talks to the network directly. This
is why the host `ProcessExecutor` cannot claim enforcement and refuses
`PolicyMode::Enforce` for network capabilities.

The goal of this remaining host-driver design is **complete interception with
a lightweight footprint**: every byte the Agent process tree sends must pass
through a pVisor-owned choke point, regardless of language runtime, linkage,
or syscall discipline — without a VM, a root daemon, or persistent elevated
privileges.

The key move is to relocate the interception point from *convention*
(environment variables the child may ignore) to *a layer the child cannot
choose to bypass*.

## Design A (primary): unprivileged network namespace + in-process userspace network stack

This is the default driver on capable Linux hosts. It mirrors the design of
pVisor's filesystem path:

```text
filesystem: pVisor embeds a FUSE server and IS the child's filesystem
network:    pVisor embeds a userspace TCP/IP stack and IS the child's network
```

### Mechanism

1. The Attempt child is spawned with `CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWNET`. Creating
   a network namespace inside a fresh user namespace requires **no
   privileges**; the namespace owner holds `CAP_NET_ADMIN` within it.
2. Inside the namespace, setup code creates a `tun` device, assigns a
   link-local subnet, and installs a default route pointing at it. Loopback is
   brought up so Run-local services keep working.
3. The `tun` file descriptor is passed back to the pVisor parent over a
   `socketpair` before `exec`. From that point pVisor owns the only egress
   path of the entire process tree.
4. pVisor runs a `smoltcp`-based userspace stack on the `tun` fd. Inbound
   TCP flows terminate in the stack and are re-originated on the host side
   after passing the `persisting-agentctl` policy gate. The existing OverlayNet
   proxy / Gateway sink remains the LLM capture path, unchanged.
5. DNS: the stack answers a virtual resolver address advertised via the
   namespace's `resolv.conf`. Queries are resolved host-side, giving a
   domain-level policy point *before* any connection exists.

### Properties

- **Topologically complete.** libc interposition, static binaries, raw
  syscalls, and forked grandchildren are all inside the namespace; there is no
  second path out. No cooperation from the child is needed or assumed.
- **Zero privilege at runtime.** No root, no setuid helper, no daemon. The
  only host prerequisite is unprivileged user namespaces
  (`kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone` / distro equivalent).
- **In-process.** Consistent with the embedded FUSE decision: pVisor does not
  spawn `passt`/`slirp4netns`-style helpers.

### Policy evaluation points

| Layer | Signal | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DNS | queried name | virtual resolver; cheapest allowlist point |
| L4 | destination IP:port | last resort for literal-IP traffic |
| TLS | SNI from ClientHello | parsed passively, no MITM, no injected CA |
| QUIC | SNI from Initial packet, or blocked | default: refuse UDP/443 to force TCP fallback |

### Failure and probing

Driver availability is probed at Attempt prepare time. If user namespaces are
unavailable, behavior depends on the requested policy mode:

- `PolicyMode::Observe`: fall back to the explicit proxy driver and record the
  downgrade in the implant plan notes.
- `PolicyMode::Enforce`: fail the Run preparation. A downgrade under Enforce
  must never be silent.

## Design B (restricted fallback): seccomp user-notify + socket broker

For hosts where unprivileged user namespaces are disabled (hardened distros,
some container runtimes), a second driver can enforce a deliberately smaller
socket surface without a namespace. It is not considered equivalent to the
netns driver unless unsupported channels are denied.

### Mechanism

1. The Attempt child installs a seccomp filter routing `socket`, `connect`,
   `sendto`, and `sendmsg` to `SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF`. `io_uring_setup`, raw
   packet sockets, namespace changes, and unmediated descriptor passing are
   denied while this driver claims enforcement.
2. `socket` is brokered: pVisor creates the socket, retains a duplicate of the
   same open file description, and injects the child descriptor with
   `SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_ADDFD`.
3. On `connect`, pVisor copies the socket address once, revalidates the
   notification cookie, evaluates policy, and performs `connect` through its
   retained descriptor. It then returns the real result without allowing the
   child's original pointer-bearing syscall to continue. This avoids a
   check-then-`CONTINUE` TOCTOU window.
4. An initial seccomp driver is TCP-only. Unconnected UDP is denied until
   OverlayNet can safely copy and broker each datagram. DNS must use a
   pVisor-provided resolver path; otherwise a domain allowlist cannot be
   reconstructed from the destination IP observed by `connect`.

### Properties and caveats

- Covers static binaries and raw syscalls for the explicitly brokered socket
  families. `AF_UNIX` gets a separate path policy; it is not blanket-allowed.
- No namespace, no tun, no userspace stack — but descriptor provenance,
  `SCM_RIGHTS`, UDP, DNS, and `io_uring` must all be closed or mediated before
  the driver is described as non-bypassable.
- Seccomp sees an IP address at `connect`, not the hostname the application
  originally resolved. Domain allowlists require mediated DNS, explicit proxy
  traffic, or SNI correlation; IP/CIDR policy can be enforced directly.
- Chosen per Attempt; Design A remains preferred when both are available.

## Enforcement vs capture are separate layers

Transparent interception provides **enforcement** (deny / allowlist) and flow
accounting. It deliberately does not decrypt:

- Enforcement needs no MITM CA: mediated DNS names and authorized destination
  addresses are sufficient for the VM MVP; a future host netns driver may add
  passive SNI parsing.
- **Capture** of LLM payloads stays on the existing explicit-proxy path:
  Gateway injects proxy configuration into known Agent CLIs and sees
  plaintext. Under a non-bypassable driver, non-cooperating traffic cannot
  leave the allowlist but is not decrypted.

Known erosion: Encrypted ClientHello will eventually hide SNI. When that
matters, deployments choose between an opt-in MITM CA for capture-grade
visibility or falling back to DNS/IP-level enforcement. This is an industry
constraint, not specific to either driver.

## Capability reporting

Per-Attempt selection determines whether a non-bypassable driver is attached;
the runtime capability catalog separately advertises VM network support.
Every Run records an
`InterceptionProfile` describing driver, strength, and protocol coverage:

- `enforce` when VM smoltcp, netns, or seccomp is active;
- `observe` when only the explicit proxy is available.

The explicit proxy foundation already emits this profile as `cooperative` and
publishes intercepted/allowed/denied/CONNECT/HTTP/sink/failure counters. These
counters prove what reached OverlayNet; they do not estimate bypassed traffic.

The honesty invariant is preserved: the host `ProcessExecutor` still never
claims network enforcement by itself; the claim is made by the active
OverlayNet driver, and `PolicyMode::Enforce` is satisfiable only while such a
driver is attached.

## Configuration

The implemented public mode selector has three values:

```toml
[overlaynet]
mode = "auto"        # auto | off | proxy
policy = "allowlist"

[[overlaynet.rules]]
host = "api.openai.com"
ports = [443]
transports = ["tcp_tunnel"]
```

For a libkrun VM, `auto` selects `vm-smoltcp`; `off` leaves the VM offline and
`proxy` is rejected because it is a host/container-only cooperative driver.
For host/container runs, explicit network flags select `proxy`; the accepted
`netns` and `seccomp` host drivers remain future internal candidates rather
than exposed configuration values. `run.json` records the driver actually
attached so `pvisor status` reports the real enforcement level.

## Non-goals

- macOS transparent *selective* interception (Network Extension, pf-based UID
  routing). Selective policy remains observe-grade; deny-all is a separate
  Seatbelt-enforced boundary and is reported as such.
- An eBPF (`cgroup/connect4`) driver. Elegant, but requires CAP_BPF/root and a
  setup-host deployment model; out of scope for now.
- TLS decryption by default. MITM stays an explicit opt-in, if ever.

## Delivery plan and acceptance gates

The VM milestone described at the start of this document is complete. The
remaining plan below applies to transparent host/container interception.

0. **Explicit proxy foundation (implemented):** honest cooperative profile,
   interception counters, strict CONNECT parsing, connect-before-200,
   streaming forwarding, dynamic hop-header stripping, redirect revalidation,
   no implicit loopback or Gateway-upstream egress trust, structured
   host/IP/CIDR + port + transport rules, post-DNS address authorization, and
   pinned authorized destinations to close policy/connector DNS races.
1. **Driver probe and selection:** extend the implemented public
   `off | proxy | auto` selector with internal netns/seccomp probes; record the
   selected profile before child exec. `Enforce` fails closed if no
   non-bypassable profile is available.
2. **Netns TCP + DNS minimum:** spawn plumbing, tun handoff, TCP relay,
   mediated resolver, DNS/IP allowlist, process-tree and namespace escape
   tests. Do not claim enforcement until raw syscalls and environment-scrubbed
   grandchildren are demonstrably contained.
3. **Protocol closure:** SNI policy, literal-IP behavior, UDP policy, blocked
   QUIC fallback, `AF_UNIX`, raw/netlink sockets, `SCM_RIGHTS`, namespace
   changes, and `io_uring` conformance cases.
4. **Restricted seccomp fallback:** broker TCP sockets first; deny uncovered
   channels. Add UDP/DNS only after descriptor and datagram semantics have
   dedicated tests.
5. **Operations:** persist final counters and downgrade reasons in `run.json`,
   expose them through `pvisor status`, and benchmark proxy/netns/seccomp modes
   separately on Python, Node, Rust, static Go, and forked grandchildren.
