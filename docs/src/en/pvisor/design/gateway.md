# pVisor Gateway — architecture and design

This page covers model routing, protocol adaptation, non-blocking capture,
and event emission. How to capture a Run belongs to the
[Capture guide](../guides/capture.md). Ownership of facts and projections
after capture belongs to
[pChronicle run storage](../../pchronicle/design/trajectory-storage.md).

This document describes the product role, core concepts, and architectural
trade-offs of **Persisting Gateway**. Implementation details (block-format
field tables, CLI flags, directory layout) are in Further reading at the

## 1. Summary

**Persisting Gateway is the trajectory observation layer for coding
agents.** Run **Claude Code** or **OpenAI Codex** through a local explicit
proxy from `persisting-overlaynet` and you get a replayable event stream,
which pChronicle then persists in structured form.

Main path:

```text
HTTP  ──►  events stream
              ├─ record (append → events.lance, SoT)
              └─ trigger (subscribe / handler)
                   └─ format conversion (via storyline hub) + persist
                      (agenticmd / atif / openai_msg / …)
```

It is an embeddable **event observer and state machine** on top of the
overlaynet proxy. On supported clients, `pvisor run` injects the proxy or
sets the model API address so that, **without changing application
code**, you can:

- transparently forward dialogue traffic to the upstream model;
- write every HTTP exchange into the **events stream** (durable and
  replayable);
- let subscriptions on events trigger materialize and export (Markdown,
  ATIF, openai_msg, and so on) instead of hard-coding formats on the
  proxy path.

Gateway is not a substitute for a general enterprise API gateway, and it
does not own the network data-plane implementation. As an OverlayNet
sink, it interprets proxy exchanges, forwards protocols, and produces
events around the **Agent trajectory**.

## 2. Problem and value

### 2.1 Typical pain points

| Pain point | Gateway response |
|------|----------------|
| Agent dialogue is scattered across vendor APIs and hard to analyze uniformly | Normalize to a shared event record, then materialize a dialogue view |
| Want logs without changing code | Reverse proxy + environment injection (`pvisor run`) |
| Need a human-reviewable session transcript | TLV Markdown: readable body, metadata in comments |
| Want streaming output visible as it is generated | Live Markdown upsert (draft block → final block) |
| Subagents and multiple sessions mix together | One file per storyline + spawn links; do not inline full subagent text |
| Capture must not delay the LLM first token | **Observation does not block**: capture is async; failures go to dead letter |

### 2.2 Client support (live capture)

| Client | `pvisor run` live capture | Notes |
|--------|:----------------------:|------|
| **Claude Code** | ✅ | Primary target: Anthropic Messages, subagent tracks, history-replay dedup |
| **OpenAI Codex** | ✅ | Responses API path; inject the gateway with `-c openai_base_url=…` and similar |
| **Cursor** | ❌ | **Not supported in this version** (no official injection or traffic adapter) |
| **Custom / generic OpenAI SDK** | ⚠️ | May work if the client uses `HTTP_PROXY` or `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`; no dedicated guarantee |

Post-hoc **import** from local IDE JSONL follows the CLI docs. Cursor
local-log import is also planned and is independent of the live-capture
table above.

### 2.3 Capability bounds

**Strengths**

- Embedded Gateway in `pvisor run` capturing **Claude Code / Codex**
  dialogue;
- History-replay dedup and subagent tracks for Claude Code;
- Responses ↔ Completions bridging and context-injection filtering for
  Codex;
- Dual storage: full Lance events plus a Markdown materialized view;
- Lightweight model routing and protocol bridging (Messages /
  Completions / Responses, and so on).

**Does not replace**

- Multi-tenant billing, complex RBAC, MCP/A2A federation, and similar
  enterprise gateways (see projects such as
  [agentgateway](https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway));
- A one-stop SDK for 100+ vendors (see LiteLLM-style projects);
- Token compression of terminal command output (complements tools such
  as [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk)).

### 2.4 Place in the Persisting ecosystem

## 3. Design principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|------|------|
| **Observation does not block** | User-request latency and success come first. Capture failures write dead letter and do **not** interrupt the HTTP response because a disk write failed. |
| **HTTP → events** | The proxy's primary product is the **events stream** (HTTP-first wire), not a direct Markdown / ATIF write. |
| **Record and trigger are separate** | The same event can **append** to storage and **fan-out** to downstream handlers; the two are decoupled. |
| **Convert through the hub** | Materialize / export goes through **storyline** (ATIF-aligned) and then to each format. Pairwise conversion among peripheral formats is forbidden. |
| **Lance is the source of truth** | Canonical storage is only `events.lance`. Markdown / ATIF and similar are **derived persistence** and may be lossy. |
| **Single write gate** | Lance appends go through one engine path, avoiding dual-write races. |

                           ▼                       │
                      storyline (hub)              │
                           │                       │
              ┌────────────┼────────────┐          │
              ▼            ▼            ▼          │
         agenticmd       atif      openai_msg …    │
              │            │            │          │
              └──────── persist / materialize ─────┘          │
                                                   │
(optional) replay from Lance ──────────────────────┘
```

Key points:

1. **overlaynet owns the proxy mechanism**: request classification,
   CONNECT, absolute-URI forwarding, egress policy, and connection
   counts.
2. **Gateway Sink owns business semantics**: LLM routing/protocol
   conversion, session association, and capture events. It does not
   implement a second proxy.
3. **The events stream is the bus**: it can be recorded and subscribed.
   The same record can persist and trigger at once.
4. **Format conversion and persistence are downstream**: they go through
   the storyline hub and emit agenticmd / atif / openai_msg and so on.

Auxiliary coordinates (session bounds, not SoT):

| Concept | Meaning |
|------|------|
| **Run** | One `pvisor run` / root workspace |
| **session** | One Agent conversation line (≈ ATIF `session_id` / storyline `session`) |
| **call_id** | Ties request/response of one HTTP round-trip (events envelope field) |

### 4.2 Layers

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Protocol layer: HTTP, SSE, OpenAI / Anthropic / Responses   │
│  Role: forward, translate; emit HTTP-first observations      │
└───────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┘
                            │ emit
                            ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  events stream                                               │
│  Role: ordered events; append records; fan-out triggers      │
└───────────────┬─────────────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                │ record                  │ trigger
                ▼                         ▼
         events.lance              handlers (interpret)
                                          │
                                          ▼
                                   storyline → persist formats
```

**Ingress**: protocol layer → events (keep the wire when possible;
summary fields are optional).
**Egress**: events replay / subscribe → storyline → derived-format
persist; decoupled from the capture hot path.

![Gateway event write and derived data flow](/img/diagrams/persisting/gateway-dataflow.svg)

### 4.3 Write path and derived path

| | Write path (record) | Derived path (trigger) |
|---|--------|--------|
| **Input** | Event emitted by proxy / import | Event already in the stream (live or replay) |
| **Output** | `events.lance` append | storyline and agenticmd / atif / … |
| **Failure** | dead letter; do not block HTTP | Independent retry; does not affect SoT |
| **Fidelity** | HTTP-first, target is replay | Lossy fold is allowed |

Live Markdown, turn indexes, and similar are **handlers triggered by
events**, not a second source of truth beside events.

 events.lance          handlers → storyline
 (SoT)                  → persist agenticmd / atif / …
```

| Component | Role |
|------|------|
| **Proxy** | Sole HTTP entry; forwards up and down stream; **emits** observations **into the events stream** (does not write multiple formats directly). |
| **events engine** | Maintains the ordered stream: **record** (append Lance) and **trigger** (fan-out handlers). |
| **Record path** | WAL → per-session ordered apply → `events.lance`. |
| **Trigger path** | Subscribe events → interpret → storyline → persist formats / Live Markdown. |
| **Session index** | Lightweight `sessions.json`: listing, tokens, cost estimates. |
| **Reconcile and dead letter** | Consistency of SoT vs derived persist; failed events can be replayed. |

### 5.2 Integration (conceptual)

- **Library embed**: a Rust project can mount OverlayNet and the Gateway
  sink and supply its own trajectory event sink.
- **CLI**: `pvisor run` wraps the child process and manages the
  Run-scoped Gateway lifecycle.
- **Config**: TOML declares listen address, model routes, capture level,
  and storage root; Agent source code does not change.

The public API is published by **module boundary** (proxy, engine,
record, trajectory, session) rather than a flat export of hundreds of
symbols. The story read model is visible mainly through snapshots and
reconcile artifacts.

### 5.3 Relationship to agentgateway

Gateway borrows a subset of agentgateway **config semantics and routing
model**, and can use its fixtures for protocol regression. The two
runtimes are **independent**. Positioning: agentgateway is a cluster-
scale multi-protocol gateway; Persisting Gateway is an **embedded,
single-node trajectory source of truth**.

---

## 6. Data flow: from HTTP to trajectory

Main path: **HTTP → events stream → (record | trigger) → persist**.

### 6.1 One dialogue request (conceptual sequence)

![Gateway capture sequence for one dialogue request](/img/diagrams/persisting/gateway-request.svg)

Key points:

1. The **Proxy does not wait** for derived persist to finish before
   responding; it emits first, then continues forwarding.
2. **Drafts trigger handlers only by default** (for example Live
   Markdown). Only a complete response is **recorded** into Lance, so
   partials do not pollute SoT.
3. Derived formats (agenticmd / atif / …) always go through
   **storyline**. They can trigger live or be replayed from Lance later.

### 6.2 Capture events and record types

The write path drives all persistence from a small set of **event
kinds**:

| Event | Typical effect (Dialogue level) |
|------|---------------------------|
| Request arrived | Lance: request record; Markdown: user block |
| Streaming draft | Markdown only: assistant draft (in-place overwrite) |
| Response complete | Lance: stream/full response record; Markdown: final assistant |
| Call canceled | Lance only: cancel record |
| Spawn link | Lance + Markdown: association metadata (not skippable noise) |

**Capture level** (Summary / Dialogue / Full) controls record grain.
Production default is **Dialogue**:

| Level | Lance / Markdown summary fields | `payload.body` |
|------|---------------------------|----------------|
| `summary` | model, path, byte counts only | ❌ |
| `dialogue` (default) | visible dialogue text in `user_content` / `assistant_content` | ❌ |
| `full` | same plus the fully parsed request/response JSON | ✅ |

Rules that omit unrelated probe traffic (for example `count_tokens`,
history replay) are independent of capture level. Materialize filtering
handles them uniformly. See §6.4 on this page.

Storage record types (`http.request` / `llm.request`,
`llm.response.stream`, `session.*`, and so on) belong to the **events
vocabulary** and are emitted by the Proxy. Handlers then fold them into
storyline; they need not map one HTTP frame to one dialogue turn.

#### 6.2.1 Timestamps and order

Every `EventRecord` that enters durable capture carries two consistent
observation times: `timestamp` (RFC3339 UTC) and `timestamp_unix_ms`
(Unix milliseconds). Request events use the time the request was
accepted; response events use the time the response was captured. The
Gateway sink is the last common write boundary and fills both values for
older producer records that lack them. Runtime lifecycle events from
pVisor also write both forms, and the two must agree at millisecond
precision.

Event order is still defined by `source + seq`. Timestamps are only for
wall-clock correlation, latency display, and cross-component alignment.
They do not replace sequence ordering. Different sources may have
independent `seq` spaces.

### 6.3 Streaming and the human-readable view

```text
Assistant:  "H" → "He" → "Hello, I can help…"
Markdown:   [draft] → [overwrite draft] → [final]
Lance:      —      —                    one final response event
```

- Draft blocks are explicitly marked. On finalize, the same block is
  overwritten by **call + role**, avoiding duplicate paragraphs.
- The block-header schema carries a version (`v: 1`) so the line format
  can evolve without changing the file suffix.

See [AgenticMD run format](../../pchronicle/reference/agenticmd.md).

### 6.4 Visible-dialogue extraction (including multimodal)

At the **Dialogue** level, Gateway extracts human-visible body text from
the client's original HTTP body (not the upstream-transformed form),
writes `payload.user_content` / `payload.assistant_content`, and drives
Markdown block bodies, frontmatter `turns`, and derived stats.

**Single entry**: the `dialogue_extract` module, branched by wire
protocol:

| Client / API | Typical path | User input | Assistant output |
|--------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Claude Code | `/v1/messages` | `content[]`: `text` / `image` / `tool_result` | SSE / JSON: `text` / `tool_use` |
| Codex | `/v1/responses` | `input[]`: `input_text` / `input_image` / tool round-trips | SSE / JSON: `output_text` / `function_call` / `image_generation_call` |
| OpenAI SDK | `/v1/chat/completions` | `messages[]`: `text` / `image_url` | `choices[].message` / streaming delta |

**Multimodal Phase 0 (current)**: images are **not written as blobs**.
Placeholders stay in the dialogue string so `turns` counts stay correct
and review still "knows there was an image":

| Direction | Placeholder example |
|------|------------|
| User input (URL) | `[image: url:https://…]` |
| User input (base64 / data URL) | `[image: base64:128KB image/png hash=abc…]` |
| Assistant image (Codex Responses) | `[image_generated: ig_xxx, png, 1024x1024, ~1MB]` + optional `prompt: …` |

An image-only user turn with no text still **counts as 1 turn** (fixes
"image but no text → stats 0 turns").
When `capture_level = full`, the complete JSON remains in
`payload.body`, but Markdown materialize **still shows only
placeholders** and does not embed pixel data.

**Later (planned)**: a sidecar asset directory
`{run}/assets/{call_id}/…` plus payload references. An internal
materializer can emit Markdown images that point at `assets/…`. The
current public `pchronicle` CLI does not reserve a command for this
plan. See §11 Evolution on this page.

Protocol regression:
`crates/persisting-gateway/tests/ag_fixture_tests.rs` +
`tests/support/ag_capture_cases.rs` (agentgateway fixture matrix).

## 7. Storage and consistency

> Dual storage, directory conventions, and materialize/import paths are
> in [Run storage](../../pchronicle/design/trajectory-storage.md).

### 7.1 Dual storage

| | Lance (source of truth) | Markdown (materialized view) |
|---|----------------|----------------------|
| **Reader** | Programs, retrieval, replay | Humans, git, review |
| **Completeness** | Lossless (within the capture level) | Lossy: filters internals and repeated history |
| **Write** | append to `events.lance` | live upsert or batch append / full materialize |
| **Relation** | row count ≥ block count (materialize only shrinks) | Rebuild from Lance can repair drift |

### 7.2 Materialize filtering (one policy)

Whether the write is live or a later materialize, **the same rules**
decide whether an event appears in Markdown, for example:

- Internal `count_tokens` and shadow-model warmup;
- Claude Code-style **history replay** (resend that does not increase
  the user-message count);
- Empty records with no visible body;
- Pure lifecycle and cancel-only records (kept in Lance).

Events that still matter to humans, such as spawn links, are **not**
dropped by mistake.

### 7.3 Session summary (frontmatter)

Each Markdown session file may carry a YAML summary: `turns`, tokens,
estimated cost, subagent list, client info, and so on.
**Turn count follows the story read model.** The in-block `turn` field
is a display heuristic only, not the authoritative count.

### 7.4 Three-track reconcile

When a Run ends normally, each session is compared:

| Track | Meaning |
|------|------|
| **Markdown** | Call set in materialized blocks |
| **Lance** | Call set that should appear as dialogue in the event log |
| **Story** | Call set obtained by replaying events |

Only when all three agree and structure checks pass is the
human-readable view considered aligned with the source of truth. On
mismatch, apply materialize or inspect dead letter rather than trusting
Markdown directly.

### 7.5 Auxiliary artifacts

| Artifact | Role |
|------|------|
| Event WAL | Replay unconfirmed capture events after a process crash |
| dead letter | Retain and replay apply failures or Lance flush failures |
| Story snapshot | On exit, freeze each Story's turn read model for summary and recovery |

---

## 8. Gateway and protocols

Persisting Gateway is a **lightweight LLM protocol gateway**. It serves
"local or team-fixed upstream + capture" and does not replace a cloud
vendor console.

| Capability | Notes |
|------|------|
| **Model routing** | Match model names in config order; prefix/wildcard and single-hop forward. |
| **Protocol bridge** | For example Anthropic Messages ↔ OpenAI Completions. Responses API falls back when the upstream is not OpenAI. |
| **Stream translation** | Unified SSE shape; TTFT observation and cached replay of reasoning fields. |
| **Auth** | Inject API keys from config, environment, or client headers; header names follow the provider. |

Gateway logic stays strictly at the **protocol layer**. It does not
enter the story-layer state machine, so routing rules stay decoupled
from turn semantics.

---

## 9. Multi-agent and sessions

### 9.1 Routing and storage keys

Each HTTP request binds a **capture route**: logical session, on-disk
storage key (which decides the `.md` filename and the Lance event-log
path), and an optional subagent id.
Under a Capture run, subagents usually write `agent-{id}.md`; the main
session writes `run-{id}.md` or a flat session name.

### 9.2 File-isolation invariants

- Subagent body text appears only in **agent-*** files;
- The main Agent's spawn references and links appear in **run-*** files
  and do **not inline** the full subagent text;
- Block-header JSON carries machine-readable links; body footnotes are
  human-only (parse roundtrip strips footnote lines).

### 9.3 Spawn linking

The spawn hint in a main-Agent assistant message and the subagent's
first-packet registration may be **time-skewed**. A Run-level registry
does delayed match and backfill so the main session can still see, after
the fact, which subagent was called and where its trajectory file is.

### 9.4 One run dataset, several `session_id`s (Claude run bucket)

A `pvisor run --record-format lance --record-destination WAREHOUSE`
pChronicle sidecar usually writes one `events.lance/` dataset under the
run directory, but in-row `session_id` **may mix several values**.
pVisor does not open Lance itself:

| Typical source | `session_id` value |
|----------|-------------------|
| pVisor lifecycle / Run header | `run-{uuid}` (matches the directory name) |
| Claude Code dialogue HTTP | UUID injected via header (different from the run id) |

So when internal stats expand a run bucket
(`session_id == root_session_id`), they first read distinct
`session_id`s from Lance, then **stat each partition**, avoiding "the
second session shows 0 turns". Implementation:
`persisting-pchronicle::expand_story_locations`. The current public CLI
exposes stats through `analysis` and `query`. See the run-bucket
partition notes in
[Run storage](../../pchronicle/design/trajectory-storage.md).

## 10. Reliability and runtime shapes

### 10.1 Reliability model

```text
Request thread ──► emit event (non-blocking WAL enqueue + apply enqueue) ──► continue forward
                    │
                    └──► background: ordered apply ──► pChronicle sidecar / Markdown
                              │
                              ├─ success → confirm WAL
                              └─ failure → dead letter + keep WAL (replay on restart; HTTP unaffected)
```

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|------|------|
| **Async apply** | Capture does not occupy the upstream connection thread |
| **Blocking-sink isolation** | sidecar durable ACK wait runs on a blocking pool, not Gateway Tokio HTTP workers |
| **Per-story ordered queue** | Event order is reproducible inside one storyline |
| **Event WAL** | The request thread only does a bounded `try_send`; the background waits at most 2 ms to batch and `sync_data`. Persisted events can replay after a crash |
| **ACK WAL** | Async best-effort batching. A lost ACK only causes safe replay. The flush/shutdown barrier persists already-received ACKs first |
| **Barrier flush** | Drain queues and actor mailboxes before graceful exit |
| **Dead letter** | Operable replay instead of silent drop |

Known limits (implementation still tightening): WAL sequence and
duplicate-delivery policy under extreme crash, and the I/O cost of
full-file Markdown upsert on very long sessions — see §11 Evolution.

### 10.2 Runtime shapes

| Shape | When to use |
|------|----------|
| **`pvisor run`** | Wrap one Agent command (for example `claude`, `codex`); inject proxy environment variables and manage the embedded Gateway |
| **pChronicle sidecar / extra Markdown** | `--record-format lance` persists to `events.lance/` via sidecar; enable `--gateway-stream-markdown` as well when live md is needed |
| **Dead letter** | Retained in Run storage for pChronicle API diagnosis |

Config excerpt:

```toml
listen = "127.0.0.1:19080"
admin_listen = "127.0.0.1:9876"
agent_id = "my-team"
capture_level = "dialogue"

[[models]]
name = "deepseek-chat"
upstream = "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
api_key_env = "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
```

The admin port serves health and session-list queries (usage, model,
active request count) for sidecar monitoring.

## 11. Evolution

!!! note "Target architecture"
    The items below are product-level directions. They are not current
    capabilities and they do not commit a schedule.

| Direction | Motive |
|------|------|
| **Multimodal sidecar (Phase 1)** | Persist base64 / generated images under `{run}/assets/`; Lance stores references only. Supports materialize embeds and controlled replay |
| **Cursor live capture and import** | Injection and JSONL import on par with Claude Code |
| Lance dataset split and compaction | Split strategy when `events.lance/` grows too large on a long run |
| Stronger WAL and sequence recovery | Lower risk of duplicate apply and seq conflict after a crash |
| Markdown append log + periodic compact | I/O and git-diff friendliness of live upsert on long sessions |
| External price table | Configurable cost estimates in the summary |
| Story read-model enrich | Close the loop on parent/child Stories, call metadata, and spawn |
| Lance column-layout optimization | Better columnar retrieval instead of large blobs |
| Narrower protocol surface | Shrink the conversion matrix as industry APIs stabilize |

Block format is explicitly versioned with `v: 1`. See
[AgenticMD run format](../../pchronicle/reference/agenticmd.md).
