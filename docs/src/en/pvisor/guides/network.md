# Control network access with OverlayNet

OverlayNet lets pVisor apply allow, deny, and bandwidth rules to network
egress. Host and container runs use its in-process HTTP proxy; libkrun VM runs
use an in-process smoltcp data plane for IPv4 TCP and DNS. Interpret these
controls with the [capability and evidence model](../concepts/capabilities-and-evidence.md).

!!! warning "Security boundary depends on the driver"
    The host/container explicit proxy is cooperative: a program can bypass it
    by removing proxy variables or opening a direct socket. VM `auto` is
    non-bypassable for the guest process tree because virtio-net terminates in
    pVisor. The VM MVP supports IPv4 TCP plus DNS; UDP, IPv6, ICMP, QUIC, and
    inbound forwarding fail closed.

## Allow only declared destinations

Pass one or more `--overlaynet-allow` options before the Agent command:

```bash
pvisor run \
  --overlaynet-allow api.openai.com:443 \
  --overlaynet-allow pypi.org:443 \
  -- agent-command
```

The presence of an allow rule enables OverlayNet and changes the default
action to deny. In this example, intercepted traffic may reach the two listed
HTTPS destinations; other intercepted destinations are rejected.

## Choose a driver mode

Use `--overlaynet off|auto|proxy` as the primary OverlayNet switch:

| Mode | Executor | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `off` | Any | Disable OverlayNet |
| `proxy` | Host/container | Cooperative host proxy |
| `auto` | VM (recommended) | Non-bypassable smoltcp data plane |

If omitted, policy flags and Gateway capture infer the executor-appropriate mode.

## Choose a policy

The policy options configure the selected driver (or infer one when no explicit
mode is supplied):

| Goal | Option | Behavior for other intercepted destinations |
|---|---|---|
| Allow only selected targets | `--overlaynet-allow TARGET` | Denied |
| Block selected targets | `--overlaynet-deny TARGET` | Allowed |
| Block all intercepted egress | `--overlaynet-deny-all` | Denied |
| Limit bandwidth | `--overlaynet-limit [TARGET=]RATE` | Unchanged |

Allow, deny, and limit options are repeatable. Explicit deny rules take
precedence over allow rules. `--overlaynet-deny-all` is a standalone policy and
cannot be combined with the other policy flags.

Targets accept an exact hostname, wildcard suffix, IP address, or CIDR, with
an optional port:

```bash
pvisor run \
  --overlaynet-allow '*.example.com:443' \
  --overlaynet-allow 203.0.113.10:443 \
  --overlaynet-deny 169.254.0.0/16 \
  -- agent-command
```

### Deny all intercepted traffic

```bash
pvisor run --overlaynet-deny-all -- agent-command
```

For host/container runs, this denies HTTP and HTTPS requests that reach the
injected proxy; it does not disable direct sockets or local Gateway routes. In
VM `auto` mode, the same policy denies ordinary guest TCP egress while the
internal Gateway route remains available when capture is enabled.

`--overlaynet-deny-all` does not support allow exceptions. If the intended
policy is “deny by default and allow only a few destinations,” do not start
with deny-all; declare the allowed targets directly:

```bash
pvisor run \
  --overlaynet-allow api.openai.com:443 \
  --overlaynet-allow pypi.org:443 \
  -- agent-command
```

The presence of `--overlaynet-allow` automatically selects the allowlist
policy: matching destinations are allowed and all other intercepted
destinations are denied by default.

### Limit bandwidth

Apply a global limit and a stricter target-specific limit:

```bash
pvisor run \
  --overlaynet-limit 10mbps \
  --overlaynet-limit api.openai.com:443=2mbps \
  -- agent-command
```

Matching limits stack, and the strictest effective rate applies. Rates ending
in `kbps`, `mbps`, or `gbps` are bits per second; `kb/s`, `mb/s`, and `gb/s`
are bytes per second. A limit constrains traffic but does not grant access.

## Use structured rules

Use a TOML configuration when a rule needs multiple ports, transport matching,
or intentional access to a private address resolved from a hostname:

```toml
[run]
command = ["agent-command"]

[overlaynet]
mode = "auto" # VM: smoltcp; use "proxy" for host/container
policy = "allowlist"

[[overlaynet.rules]]
host = "api.example.com"
ports = [443]
transports = ["tcp_tunnel"]
allow_private_ips = false

[[overlaynet.deny]]
host = "169.254.0.0/16"

[[overlaynet.limits]]
host = "api.example.com"
port = 443
bytes_per_second = 250000
```

Run it with:

```bash
pvisor run --spec run.toml
```

Supported transport values are `http`, `https`, and `tcp_tunnel`. Empty
`ports` or `transports` mean unrestricted for that dimension.

Hostname rules reject private and loopback DNS results by default. For an
intentional private service, prefer an explicit IP/CIDR rule; alternatively,
set `allow_private_ips = true` on a narrowly scoped hostname rule. Link-local
and other special-purpose ranges still require an explicit IP or CIDR rule.

If the host uses a DNS/TUN fake-IP connector, VM egress accepts a `198.18/15`
result as an opaque connector alias only after the logical hostname and port
are authorized. A guest cannot connect to that range as an IP literal. The
connector does not expose the real final address, so use a concrete-address
resolver when IP/CIDR policy for hostname results is required.

## Understand which clients are controlled

For host and container runs, pVisor injects `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, their
lowercase forms, and `ALL_PROXY` into the Agent process. HTTP clients that
honor these settings are routed through OverlayNet. The proxy handles ordinary
HTTP forwarding and HTTPS `CONNECT` tunnels.

The following paths are outside that cooperative host/container boundary:

- a client that ignores or removes the proxy environment;
- a destination added to `NO_PROXY`;
- a program that opens a direct socket;
- DNS and UDP traffic that does not pass through the HTTP proxy.

Consequently, a host/container cooperative-proxy Run reports
`safety.network_non_bypassable = false`. When direct network access must be
blocked, use `pvisor -- --overlaynet-deny-all`: Linux adds a private
network namespace; macOS blocks non-loopback IP and ambient host Unix sockets with Seatbelt,
while retaining loopback proxy access and the exact AgentCtl and Run-local IPC. Container Runs can instead
use `--container-network none`. Selective allow/deny rules remain cooperative
on both native host paths. The VM executor defaults to `[overlaynet] mode =
"auto"`, which supplies DHCP, synthetic DNS, and policy-controlled IPv4 TCP;
`mode = "off"` leaves it offline. Gateway capture uses the guest virtual
router. The container executor still requires `--container-network host` for
the in-process proxy.

## Review the result

The current directory is the default reusable workspace. Each invocation keeps
an independent Run under pVisor's default records root:

```bash
pvisor run \
  --overlaynet-deny 169.254.0.0/16 \
  -- agent-command

pvisor review --json last | jq '{policy: .network.policy,
     interception: .network.interception,
     counters: .network.intercepted,
     non_bypassable: .safety.network_non_bypassable}'
```

The counters describe traffic handled by the active OverlayNet driver. They
cannot count traffic that bypassed the cooperative host/container proxy; the
VM smoltcp profile has no guest network path around its supported TCP/DNS data
plane.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| An allowed hostname resolves to loopback or a private address | Use an explicit IP/CIDR rule, or a narrowly scoped structured rule with `allow_private_ips = true` |
| A request succeeds under `--overlaynet-deny-all` | Confirm the client honors the injected proxy and does not use `NO_PROXY` or a direct socket |
| pVisor cannot bind the proxy | Select a free non-zero address with `--overlaynet-listen 127.0.0.1:19082` |
| A container cannot reach the proxy | Use `--container-network host` |
| VM `proxy` mode is rejected | Use `auto` for the smoltcp driver, or `off` for an offline guest |
