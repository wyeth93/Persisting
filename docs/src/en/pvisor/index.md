**pVisor runs an existing Agent command inside a controlled execution
environment.** It gives each Run its own workspace boundary, records the
controls that were actually installed, and lets you review filesystem changes
before they reach the project.

In Persisting, pVisor runs one Agent and reviews its changes. You can use it
without pChronicle.

:::tip What you will complete
By the end of the first walkthrough: the Agent has stopped; its changes remain
in a Run-owned staging directory; you deliberately write them into the project
or discard them. Your first `pvisor review` shows the record of controls that
were actually installed.
:::

pVisor does not replace the Agent's reasoning loop. You can keep using Agent
CLIs, scripts, and frameworks you already have.

## Run, review, decide

From a project directory:

```bash
pvisor run --stage ./runs/task-001 -- codex
pvisor review last
pvisor apply last --path src
```

With `--stage ./runs/task-001`, the Agent writes to a staged view of the project. After the Run,
you can apply all changes, accept selected paths in several batches, or discard
the stage:

```bash
pvisor apply last --all
# or
pvisor drop last
```

The exact filesystem and network boundary depends on the platform and chosen
executor. pVisor records the effective controls so that a Run is not described
as more isolated than it was.

## Choose your next step

Start with [Run your first Agent](get-started.md) if this is your first
session. It ends with a reviewed stage and gives you the vocabulary used by
the rest of the documentation.

When you already know what you need, follow the matching path:

- **Keep or discard changes:** [Review and apply](guides/review-apply.md)
- **Compare host, container, and VM:** [Execution layouts](guides/execution.md)
- **Constrain network access:** [Network policy](guides/network.md)
- **Publish trajectory events:** [Capture trajectories](guides/capture.md)
- **Look up exact flags:** [CLI reference](reference/cli.md)

pVisor's local run-review-apply loop works on its own. pChronicle is optional:
use it when you want to retain and query trajectory Datasets after a Run.

## A useful reading order

1. [Run your first Agent](get-started.md) to see the complete success loop.
2. [Review and apply](guides/review-apply.md) when you need finer control over changes.
3. [Execution layouts](guides/execution.md) when provider boundaries affect your decision.
4. [Capabilities and evidence](concepts/capabilities-and-evidence.md) when you need to interpret a Run Bundle.
5. [CLI reference](reference/cli.md) only when you need an exact flag or output field.
